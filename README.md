# filemanager
A command line file manager written in Rust. 

The purpose of this project is twofold:

- Get a file manager that I like and runs well on my Raspberry Pi (I previously used [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), which is nice but runs extremely slowly on the Pi, because it's written in Python)
- Learn Rust
